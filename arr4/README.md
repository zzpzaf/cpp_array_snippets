<p style="background-color:cadetblue; color:white; padding-left:5px"> Using a  <span style="color:yellow"> vector </span> and a function that returns a <span style="color:yellow"> vector </span> of integers</p>

A very simple example that uses and returns a vector of <u>integers</u> from a function.

Generally in C++, we cannot return an array from a function. 


## A few words about  <span style="color:red">vectors</span>

Using vectors might be is the most preferable approach, when you want to return a set of values. This is because vectors they act similarly to array structures (LIFO sequence containers), and they are very handy to be resized (adding, deleting items). Moreover, the destruction of a vector is automatic once the vector goes out scope, and the allocated memory is free back on the heap. Vectors are base on the **std::vector** class template that contains the vector container and its member functions. It is defined inside the <vector> header file.

###The code

```
//4-Using a vector and a function that returns a vector

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> getintegersvector();


std::vector<int> getintegersvector() { 

    int aa = 100;
    int bb = 200;


    //std::vector<int> v_arr{aa,bb};
    //std::vector<int> v_arr(2,0);
    std::vector<int> v_arr;

    v_arr.push_back(aa);
    v_arr.push_back(bb);

    return v_arr;

}

//calling...

int main() { 

       
    //std::cout <<  getintegersvector().at(0) << "," << getintegersvector().at(1) << "\n";

    std::vector<int> v = getintegersvector();
    v.push_back(300);
    std::cout <<  v.at(0) << "," << v.at(1) << "," << v.at(2) << "\n";


    return 0; 
}


```
